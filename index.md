This is just an example of creating an index file.

## CONTENTS

### Markdown

I like markdown because it's so natural to write rich content:

For example, here is an ordered list:
1. First things first
2. Second thing
   1. Sub-second-thing
   2. Another sub-second thing
3. Last thing

Or a bulleted list:
* rage
* more rage 
* RAGE!

Or links to things:
